# Predicting Horse Racing Finishes :horse_racing::  
## By: Patrick Bovard  
## *Metis Data Science Bootcamp Winter 2021 Project 3*  

**Description**:  
The goal of this project is to use Horse racing data from the Hong Kong Jockey Club races to predict whether a horse will show (i.e. place first, second, or third) or not in a given race.  This will be done by building a classification model, using race finish position as the target (show or not show) with various features about the horse as features.  

**Features and Target Variables**:  
- Target Variable: will a given racehorse **Show** (i.e. place 1st, 2nd, or 3rd) or **Not Show** (i.e. place 4th or lower) in a given race  
- Features: Horse Age, Horse Rating, Declared weight of horse and jockey, horse type (i.e. sex), actual weight applied to horse (i.e. race handicapping), etc.  *More to come*  
  
**Data Used**:  
- Data for this project was pulled from [Graham Daley's Horse Racing in HK Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/gdaley/hkracing).  

**Tools Used:**  
- Data Analysis and Model Building: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
  
**Possible Impacts of this project:**  
Possible impacts of this project include utilization on the gambling side of horse racing, or for a horse's owner to determine if their horse is likely to have a good performance in a given race.  While this data focuses on Hong Kong racing, it is hopeful that similar techniques could be applied to other area, such as the United States.
